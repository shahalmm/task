       "[Document(page_content='The world ocean or ocean sea is the body of salt water that covers ~70.8% of the Earth. [8] In English, the term ocean also refers to any of the large bodies of water into which the world ocean is conventionally divided. [9] Distinct names are used to identify five different areas of the ocean: Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Antarctic/Southern, and Arctic. [10][11] The ocean contains 97% of Earth\\'s water[8] and is the primary component of the Earth\\'s hydrosphere, thus the ocean is essential to life on Earth. The ocean influences climate and weather patterns, the carbon cycle, and the water cycle by acting as a huge heat reservoir.\\n\\nOceanographers split the ocean into vertical and horizontal zones based on physical and biological conditions. The pelagic zone is the open ocean\\'s water column from the surface to the ocean floor. The water column is further divided into zones based on depth and the amount of light present. The photic zone starts at the surface and is defined to be \"the depth at which light intensity is only 1% of the surface value\"[12]:\\u200a36\\u200a (approximately 200 m in the open ocean). This is the zone where photosynthesis can occur. In this process plants and microscopic algae (free floating phytoplankton) use light, water, carbon dioxide, and nutrients to produce organic matter. As a result, the photic zone is the most biodiverse and the source of the food supply which sustains most of the ocean ecosystem. Ocean photosynthesis also produces half of the oxygen in the Earth\\'s atmosphere. [13] Light can only penetrate a few hundred more meters; the rest of the deeper ocean is cold and dark (these zones are called mesopelagic and aphotic zones). The continental shelf is where the ocean meets dry land. It is more shallow, with a depth of a few hundred meters or less. Human activity often has negative impacts on the ecosystems within the continental shelf.\\n\\nOcean temperatures depend on the amount of solar radiation reaching the ocean surface. In the tropics, surface temperatures can rise to over 30 °C (86 °F). Near the poles where sea ice forms, the temperature in equilibrium is about −2 °C (28 °F). In all parts of the ocean, deep ocean temperatures range between −2 °C (28 °F) and 5 °C (41 °F). [14] Constant circulation of water in the ocean creates ocean currents. These directed movements of seawater are caused by forces operating on the water, such as temperature variations, atmospheric circulation (wind), the Coriolis effect and salinity changes. [15] Tides create tidal currents, while wind and waves cause surface currents. The Gulf Stream, Kuroshio Current, Agulhas Current and Antarctic Circumpolar Current are all major ocean currents. Currents transport massive amounts of water and heat around the world. By transporting these pollutants from the surface into the deep ocean, this circulation impacts global climate and the uptake and redistribution of pollutants such as carbon dioxide.\\n\\nOcean water contains a high concentration of dissolved gases, including oxygen, carbon dioxide and nitrogen. This gas exchange occurs at the ocean\\'s surface and solubility depends on the temperature and salinity of the water. [16] Carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere rises due to fossil fuel combustion, which causes higher levels in ocean water, resulting in ocean acidification. [17] The ocean provides crucial environmental services to humankind, such as climate regulation. It also provides a means of trade and transport as well as access to food and other resources. It is known to be the habitat of over 230,000 species, but may hold considerably more – perhaps over two million species. [18] However, the ocean faces numerous human-caused environmental threats, such as marine pollution, overfishing, and effects of climate change on oceans such as ocean warming, ocean acidification and sea level rise. The continental shelf and coastal waters that are most affected by human activity are particularly vulnerable.\\n\\nTerminology Ocean and sea The terms \"the ocean\" or \"the sea\" used without specification refer to the interconnected body of salt water covering the majority of the Earth\\'s surface. [10][11] It includes the Atlantic, Pacific, Indian, Antarctic/Southern and Arctic Oceans. [19] As a general term, \"the ocean\" and \"the sea\" are often interchangeable, although speakers of British English refer to \"the sea\" in all cases,[20][dubious – discuss] even when the body of water is one of the oceans.\\n\\nStrictly speaking, a \"sea\" is a body of water (generally a division of the world ocean) partly or fully enclosed by land. [21] The word \"sea\" can also be used for many specific, much smaller bodies of seawater, such as the North Sea or the Red Sea. There is no sharp distinction between seas and oceans, though generally seas are smaller, and are often partly (as marginal seas) or wholly (as inland seas) bordered by land. [22]\\n\\nWorld ocean \"World Ocean\" redirects here. Not to be confused with Ocean World. The contemporary concept of the World Ocean was coined in the early 20th century by the Russian oceanographer Yuly Shokalsky to refer to the continuous ocean that covers and encircles most of the Earth. [23][24] The global, interconnected body of salt water is sometimes referred to as the World Ocean, global ocean or the great ocean. [25][26][27] The concept of a continuous body of water with relatively unrestricted exchange between its components is critical in oceanography. [28]\\n\\nEtymology The word ocean comes from the figure in classical antiquity, Oceanus (/oʊˈsiːənəs/; Greek: Ὠκεανός Ōkeanós,[29] pronounced [ɔːkeanós]), the elder of the Titans in classical Greek mythology. Oceanus was believed by the ancient Greeks and Romans to be the divine personification of an enormous river encircling the world.\\n\\nThe concept of Ōkeanós has an Indo-European connection. Greek Ōkeanós has been compared to the Vedic epithet ā-śáyāna-, predicated of the dragon Vṛtra-, who captured the cows/rivers. Related to this notion, the Okeanos is represented with a dragon-tail on some early Greek vases. [30]\\n\\nNatural history Further information: List of ancient oceans Origin of water Further information: Origin of water on Earth Scientists believe that a sizable quantity of water would have been in the material that formed Earth. [31] Water molecules would have escaped Earth\\'s gravity more easily when it was less massive during its formation. This is called atmospheric escape.\\n\\nDuring planetary formation, Earth possibly had magma oceans. Subsequently, outgassing, volcanic activity and meteorite impacts, produced an early atmosphere of carbon dioxide, nitrogen and water vapor, according to current theories. The gases and the atmosphere are thought to have accumulated over millions of years. After Earth\\'s surface had significantly cooled, the water vapor over time would have condensed, forming Earth\\'s first oceans. [32] The early oceans might have been significantly hotter than today and appeared green due to high iron content. [33]\\n\\nGeological evidence helps constrain the time frame for liquid water existing on Earth. A sample of pillow basalt (a type of rock formed during an underwater eruption) was recovered from the Isua Greenstone Belt and provides evidence that water existed on Earth 3.8 billion years ago. [34] In the Nuvvuagittuq Greenstone Belt, Quebec, Canada, rocks dated at 3.8 billion years old by one study[35] and 4.28 billion years old by another[36] show evidence of the presence of water at these ages. [34] If oceans existed earlier than this, any geological evidence either has yet to be discovered, or has since been destroyed by geological processes like crustal recycling. However, in August 2020, researchers reported that sufficient water to fill the oceans may have always been on the Earth since the beginning of the planet\\'s formation. [37][38][39] In this model, atmospheric greenhouse gases kept the oceans from freezing when the newly forming Sun had only 70% of its current luminosity. [40]\\n\\nOcean formation Main article: Paleoceanography The origin of Earth\\'s oceans is unknown. Oceans are thought to have formed in the Hadean eon and may have been the cause for the emergence of life.\\n\\nPlate tectonics, post-glacial rebound, and sea level rise continually change the coastline and structure of the world ocean. A global ocean has existed in one form or another on Earth for eons.\\n\\nSince its formation the ocean has taken many conditions and shapes with many past ocean divisions and potentially at times covering the whole globe. [41]\\n\\nDuring colder climatic periods, more ice caps and glaciers form, and enough of the global water supply accumulates as ice to lessen the amounts in other parts of the water cycle. The reverse is true during warm periods. During the last ice age, glaciers covered almost one-third of Earth\\'s land mass with the result being that the oceans were about 122 m (400 ft) lower than today. During the last global \"warm spell,\" about 125,000 years ago, the seas were about 5.5 m (18 ft) higher than they are now. About three million years ago the oceans could have been up to 50 m (165 ft) higher. [42]\\n\\nGeography Further information: Water distribution on Earth\\n\\nWorld map of the five-ocean model with approximate boundaries The entire ocean, containing 97% of Earth\\'s water, spans 70.8% of Earth\\'s surface,[8] making it Earth\\'s global ocean or world ocean. [23][25] This makes Earth, along with its vibrant hydrosphere a \"water world\"[43][44] or \"ocean world\",[45][46] particularly in Earth\\'s early history when the ocean is thought to have possibly covered Earth completely. [41] The ocean\\'s shape is irregular, unevenly dominating the Earth\\'s surface. This leads to the distinction of the Earth\\'s surface into a water and land hemisphere, as well as the division of the ocean into different oceans.\\n\\nSeawater covers about 361,000,000 km2 (139,000,000 sq mi) and the Ocean\\'s furthest pole of inaccessibility, known as \"Point Nemo\", in a region known as spacecraft cemetery of the South Pacific Ocean, at 48°52.6′S 123°23.6′W. This point is roughly 2,688 km (1,670 mi) from the nearest land. [47]\\n\\nOceanic divisions Further information: Borders of the oceans\\n\\nMap of Earth centered on its ocean, showing the different ocean divisions There are different customs to subdivide the ocean and are adjourned by smaller bodies of water such as, seas, gulfs, bays, bights, and straits.\\n\\nThe Ocean is customarily divided into five principal oceans – listed below in descending order of area and volume:\\n\\nOceans by size #\\tOcean\\tLocation\\tArea (km2)\\tVolume (km3)\\tAvg. depth (m)\\tCoastline (km)[48] 1\\tPacific Ocean\\tBetween Asia and Australasia and the Americas[49]\\t168,723,000 (46.6%)\\t669,880,000 (50.1%)\\t3,970\\t135,663 (35.9%) 2\\tAtlantic Ocean\\tBetween the Americas and Europe and Africa[50]\\t85,133,000 (23.5%)\\t310,410,900 (23.3%)\\t3,646\\t111,866 (29.6%) 3\\tIndian Ocean\\tBetween southern Asia, Africa and Australia[51]\\t70,560,000 (19.5%)\\t264,000,000 (19.8%)\\t3,741\\t66,526 (17.6%) 4\\tAntarctic/Southern Ocean\\tBetween Antarctica and the Pacific, Atlantic and Indian oceans Sometimes considered an extension of those three oceans.

Earth\\'s oceanic basins cover different geologic provinces of Earth\\'s oceanic crust as well as continental crust. As such it covers mainly Earth\\'s structural basins, but also continental shelfs.\\n\\nIn mid-ocean, magma is constantly being thrust through the seabed between adjoining plates to form mid-oceanic ridges and here convection currents within the mantle tend to drive the two plates apart. Parallel to these ridges and nearer the coasts, one oceanic plate may slide beneath another oceanic plate in a process known as subduction. Deep trenches are formed here and the process is accompanied by friction as the plates grind together. The movement proceeds in jerks which cause earthquakes, heat is produced and magma is forced up creating underwater mountains, some of which may form chains of volcanic islands near to deep trenches. Near some of the boundaries between the land and sea, the slightly denser oceanic plates slide beneath the continental plates and more subduction trenches are formed. As they grate together, the continental plates are deformed and buckle causing mountain building and seismic activity. [57][58]\\n\\nEvery ocean basin has a mid-ocean ridge, which creates a long mountain range beneath the ocean. Together they form the global mid-oceanic ridge system that features the longest mountain range in the world. The longest continuous mountain range is 65,000 km (40,000 mi). This underwater mountain range is several times longer than the longest continental mountain range – the Andes. [59]\\n\\nOceanographers state that less than 20% of the oceans have been mapped. [60][vague]\\n\\nInteraction with the coast\\n\\nMain article: Coast\\n\\nPraia da Marinha in Algarve, Portugal The zone where land meets sea is known as the coast and the part between the lowest spring tides and the upper limit reached by splashing waves is the shore. A beach is the accumulation of sand or shingle on the shore. [61] A headland is a point of land jutting out into the sea and a larger promontory is known as a cape. The indentation of a coastline, especially between two headlands, is a bay, a small bay with a narrow inlet is a cove and a large bay may be referred to as a gulf. [62] Coastlines are influenced by several factors including the strength of the waves arriving on the shore, the gradient of the land margin, the composition and hardness of the coastal rock, the inclination of the off-shore slope and the changes of the level of the land due to local uplift or submergence. [61]\\n\\nNormally, waves roll towards the shore at the rate of six to eight per minute and these are known as constructive waves as they tend to move material up the beach and have little erosive effect. Storm waves arrive on shore in rapid succession and are known as destructive waves as the swash moves beach material seawards. Under their influence, the sand and shingle on the beach is ground together and abraded. Around high tide, the power of a storm wave impacting on the foot of a cliff has a shattering effect as air in cracks and crevices is compressed and then expands rapidly with release of pressure. At the same time, sand and pebbles have an erosive effect as they are thrown against the rocks. This tends to undercut the cliff, and normal weathering processes such as the action of frost follows, causing further destruction. Gradually, a wave-cut platform develops at the foot of the cliff and this has a protective effect, reducing further wave-erosion. [61]\\n\\nMaterial worn from the margins of the land eventually ends up in the sea. Here it is subject to attrition as currents flowing parallel to the coast scour out channels and transport sand and pebbles away from their place of origin. Sediment carried to the sea by rivers settles on the seabed causing deltas to form in estuaries. All these materials move back and forth under the influence of waves, tides and currents. [61] Dredging removes material and deepens channels but may have unexpected effects elsewhere on the coastline. Governments make efforts to prevent flooding of the land by the building of breakwaters, seawalls, dykes and levees and other sea defences. For instance, the Thames Barrier is designed to protect London from a storm surge,[63] while the failure of the dykes and levees around New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina created a humanitarian crisis in the United States.\\n\\nPhysical properties\\n\\nColor\\n\\nOcean chlorophyll concentration is a proxy for phytoplankton biomass. In this map, blue colors represent lower chlorophyll and reds represent higher chlorophyll. Satellite-measured chlorophyll is estimated based on ocean color by how green the color of the water appears from space. This section is an excerpt from Ocean color. [edit] Most of the ocean is blue in color, but in some places the ocean is blue-green, green, or even yellow to brown. [64] Blue ocean color is a result of several factors. First, water preferentially absorbs red light, which means that blue light remains and is reflected back out of the water. Red light is most easily absorbed and thus does not reach great depths, usually to less than 50 meters (164 ft). Blue light, in comparison, can penetrate up to 200 meters (656 ft). [65] Second, water molecules and very tiny particles in ocean water preferentially scatter blue light more than light of other colors. Blue light scattering by water and tiny particles happens even in the very clearest ocean water,[66] and is similar to blue light scattering in the sky.\\n\\nThe main substances that affect the color of the ocean include dissolved organic matter, living phytoplankton with chlorophyll pigments, and non-living particles like marine snow and mineral sediments. [67] Chlorophyll can be measured by satellite observations and serves as a proxy for ocean productivity (marine primary productivity) in surface waters. In long term composite satellite images, regions with high ocean productivity show up in yellow and green colors because they contain more (green) phytoplankton, whereas areas of low productivity show up in blue. Water cycle, weather and rainfall Further information: Effects of climate change on the water cycle and Water distribution on Earth\\n\\nThe ocean is a major driver of Earth\\'s water cycle. Ocean water represents the largest body of water within the global water cycle (oceans contain 97% of Earth\\'s water). Evaporation from the ocean moves water into the atmosphere to later rain back down onto land and the ocean. [68] Oceans have a significant effect on the biosphere. The ocean as a whole is thought to cover approximately 90% of the Earth\\'s biosphere. [60] Oceanic evaporation, as a phase of the water cycle, is the source of most rainfall (about 90%),[68] causing a global cloud cover of 67% and a consistent oceanic cloud cover of 72%. [69] Ocean temperatures affect climate and wind patterns that affect life on land. One of the most dramatic forms of weather occurs over the oceans: tropical cyclones (also called \"typhoons\" and \"hurricanes\" depending upon where the system forms).\\n\\nAs the world\\'s ocean is the principal component of Earth\\'s hydrosphere, it is integral to life on Earth, forms part of the carbon cycle and water cycle, and – as a huge heat reservoir – influences climate and weather patterns.\\n\\nWaves and swell Duration: 13 seconds.0:13 Movement of water as waves pass Main articles: Wind wave and Swell (ocean) The motions of the ocean surface, known as undulations or wind waves, are the partial and alternate rising and falling of the ocean surface. The series of mechanical waves that propagate along the interface between water and air is called swell – a term used in sailing, surfing and navigation. [70] These motions profoundly affect ships on the surface of the ocean and the well-being of people on those ships who might suffer from sea sickness.\\n\\nWind blowing over the surface of a body of water forms waves that are perpendicular to the direction of the wind. The friction between air and water caused by a gentle breeze on a pond causes ripples to form. A strong blow over the ocean causes larger waves as the moving air pushes against the raised ridges of water. The waves reach their maximum height when the rate at which they are travelling nearly matches the speed of the wind. In open water, when the wind blows continuously as happens in the Southern Hemisphere in the Roaring Forties, long, organized masses of water called swell roll across the ocean. [71]:\\u200a83–84\\u200a[72][73] If the wind dies down, the wave formation is reduced, but already-formed waves continue to travel in their original direction until they meet land. The size of the waves depends on the fetch, the distance that the wind has blown over the water and the strength and duration of that wind. When waves meet others coming from different directions, interference between the two can produce broken, irregular seas. [72]\\n\\nConstructive interference can lead to the formation of unusually high rogue waves. [74] Most waves are less than 3 m (10 ft) high[74] and it is not unusual for strong storms to double or triple that height. [75] Rogue waves, however, have been documented at heights above 25 meters (82 ft). [76][77]\\n\\nThe top of a wave is known as the crest, the lowest point between waves is the trough and the distance between the crests is the wavelength. The wave is pushed across the surface of the ocean by the wind, but this represents a transfer of energy and not horizontal movement of water. As waves approach land and move into shallow water, they change their behavior. If approaching at an angle, waves may bend (refraction) or wrap around rocks and headlands (diffraction). When the wave reaches a point where its deepest oscillations of the water contact the ocean floor, they begin to slow down. This pulls the crests closer together and increases the waves\\' height, which is called wave shoaling. When the ratio of the wave\\'s height to the water depth increases above a certain limit, it \"breaks\", toppling over in a mass of foaming water. [74] This rushes in a sheet up the beach before retreating into the ocean under the influence of gravity. [78]\\n\\nEarthquakes, volcanic eruptions or other major geological disturbances can set off waves that can lead to tsunamis in coastal areas which can be very dangerous. [79][80]\\n\\nSea level and surface Further information: Sea level and Sea level rise The ocean\\'s surface is an important reference point for oceanography and geography, particularly as mean sea level. The ocean surface has globally little, but measurable topography, depending on the ocean\\'s volumes.\\n\\nThe ocean surface is a crucial interface for oceanic and atmospheric processes. Allowing interchange of particles, enriching the air and water, as well as grounds by some particles becoming sediments. This interchange has fertilized life in the ocean, on land and air. All these processes and components together make up ocean surface ecosystems.\\n\\nTides\\n\\nMain article: Tide\\n\\nHigh tide and low tide in the Bay of Fundy, Canada. Tides are the regular rise and fall in water level experienced by oceans, primarily driven by the Moon\\'s gravitational tidal forces upon the Earth. Tidal forces affect all matter on Earth, but only fluids like the ocean demonstrate the effects on human timescales. (For example, tidal forces acting on rock may produce tidal locking between two planetary bodies.) Though primarily driven by the Moon\\'s gravity, oceanic tides are also substantially modulated by the Sun\\'s tidal forces, by the rotation of the Earth, and by the shape of the rocky continents blocking oceanic water flow. (Tidal forces vary more with distance than the \"base\" force of gravity: the Moon\\'s tidal forces on Earth are more than double the Sun\\'s,[81] despite the latter\\'s much stronger gravitational force on Earth. Earth\\'s tidal forces upon the Moon are 20x stronger than the Moon\\'s tidal forces on the Earth.)\\n\\nThe primary effect of lunar tidal forces is to bulge Earth matter towards the near and far sides of the Earth, relative to the moon. The \"perpendicular\" sides, from which the Moon appears in line with the local horizon, experience \"tidal troughs\". Since it takes nearly 25 hours for the Earth to rotate under the Moon (accounting for the Moon\\'s 28 day orbit around Earth), tides thus cycle over a course of 12.5 hours. However, the rocky continents pose obstacles for the tidal bulges, so the timing of tidal maxima may not actually align with the Moon in most localities on Earth, as the oceans are forced to \"dodge\" the continents. Timing and magnitude of tides vary widely across the Earth as a result of the continents. Thus, knowing the Moon\\'s position does not allow a local to predict tide timings, instead requiring precomputed tide tables which account for the continents and the Sun, among others.\\n\\nDuring each tidal cycle, at any given place the tidal waters rise to maximum height, high tide, before ebbing away again to the minimum level, low tide. As the water recedes, it gradually reveals the foreshore, also known as the intertidal zone. The difference in height between the high tide and low tide is known as the tidal range or tidal amplitude. [82][83] When the sun and moon are aligned (full moon or new moon), the combined effect results in the higher \"spring tides\", while the sun and moon misaligning (half moons) result in lesser tidal ranges. [82]\\n\\nIn the open ocean tidal ranges are less than 1 meter, but in coastal areas these tidal ranges increase to more than 10 meters in some areas. [84] Some of the largest tidal ranges in the world occur in the Bay of Fundy and Ungava Bay in Canada, reaching up to 16 meters. [85] Other locations with record high tidal ranges include the Bristol Channel between England and Wales, Cook Inlet in Alaska, and the Río Gallegos in Argentina. [86]\\n\\nTides are not to be confused with storm surges, which can occur when high winds pile water up against the coast in a shallow area and this, coupled with a low pressure system, can raise the surface of the ocean dramatically above a typical high tide.\\n\\nDepth Further information: Bathymetry The average depth of the oceans is about 4 km. More precisely the average depth is 3,688 meters (12,100 ft). [72] Nearly half of the world\\'s marine waters are over 3,000 meters (9,800 ft) deep. [27] \"Deep ocean,\" which is anything below 200 meters (660 ft), covers about 66% of Earth\\'s surface. [87] This figure does not include seas not connected to the World Ocean, such as the Caspian Sea.\\n\\nThe deepest region of the ocean is at the Mariana Trench, located in the Pacific Ocean near the Northern Mariana Islands. [88] The maximum depth has been estimated to be 10,971 meters (35,994 ft). The British naval vessel Challenger II surveyed the trench in 1951 and named the deepest part of the trench the \"Challenger Deep\". In 1960, the Trieste successfully reached the bottom of the trench, manned by a crew of two men.\\n\\nOceanic zones Further information: Ocean stratification Drawing showing divisions according to depth and distance from shore The major oceanic zones, based on depth and biophysical conditions Oceanographers classify the ocean into vertical and horizontal zones based on physical and biological conditions. The pelagic zone consists of the water column of the open ocean, and can be divided into further regions categorized by light abundance and by depth.\\n\\nGrouped by light penetration Further information: Photic zone, Mesopelagic zone, and Aphotic zone The ocean zones can be grouped by light penetration into (from top to bottom): the photic zone, the mesopelagic zone and the aphotic deep ocean zone:\\n\\nThe photic zone is defined to be \"the depth at which light intensity is only 1% of the surface value\". [12]:\\u200a36\\u200a This is usually up to a depth of approximately 200 m in the open ocean. It is the region where photosynthesis can occur and is, therefore, the most biodiverse. Photosynthesis by plants and microscopic algae (free floating phytoplankton) allows the creation of organic matter from chemical precursors including water and carbon dioxide. This organic matter can then be consumed by other creatures. Much of the organic matter created in the photic zone is consumed there but some sinks into deeper waters. The pelagic part of the photic zone is known as the epipelagic. [89] The actual optics of light reflecting and penetrating at the ocean surface are complex. [12]:\\u200a34–39 Below the photic zone is the mesopelagic or twilight zone where there is a very small amount of light. The basic concept is that with that little light photosynthesis is unlikely to achieve any net growth over respiration. [12]:\\u200a116–124 Below that is the aphotic deep ocean to which no surface sunlight at all penetrates. Life that exists deeper than the photic zone must either rely on material sinking from above (see marine snow) or find another energy source. Hydrothermal vents are a source of energy in what is known as the aphotic zone (depths exceeding 200 m).\\n\\n[89] Grouped by depth and temperature The pelagic part of the aphotic zone can be further divided into vertical regions according to depth and temperature:[89]\\n\\nThe mesopelagic is the uppermost region. Its lowermost boundary is at a thermocline of 12 °C (54 °F) which generally lies at 700–1,000 meters (2,300–3,300 ft) in the tropics. Next is the bathypelagic lying between 10 and 4 °C (50 and 39 °F), typically between 700–1,000 meters (2,300–3,300 ft) and 2,000–4,000 meters (6,600–13,100 ft). Lying along the top of the abyssal plain is the abyssopelagic, whose lower boundary lies at about 6,000 meters (20,000 ft). The last and deepest zone is the hadalpelagic which includes the oceanic trench and lies between 6,000–11,000 meters (20,000–36,000 ft). The benthic zones are aphotic and correspond to the three deepest zones of the deep-sea. The bathyal zone covers the continental slope down to about 4,000 meters (13,000 ft). The abyssal zone covers the abyssal plains between 4,000 and 6,000 m. Lastly, the hadal zone corresponds to the hadalpelagic zone, which is found in oceanic trenches. Distinct boundaries between ocean surface waters and deep waters can be drawn based on the properties of the water. These boundaries are called thermoclines (temperature), haloclines (salinity), chemoclines (chemistry), and pycnoclines (density). If a zone undergoes dramatic changes in temperature with depth, it contains a thermocline, a distinct boundary between warmer surface water and colder deep water. In tropical regions, the thermocline is typically deeper compared to higher latitudes.\\n\\nUnlike polar waters, where solar energy input is limited, temperature stratification is less pronounced, and a distinct thermocline is often absent. This is due to the fact that surface waters in polar latitudes are nearly as cold as deeper waters. Below the thermocline, water everywhere in the ocean is very cold, ranging from −1 °C to 3 °C. Because this deep and cold layer contains the bulk of ocean water, the average temperature of the world ocean is 3.9 °C. [90] If a zone undergoes dramatic changes in salinity with depth, it contains a halocline. If a zone undergoes a strong, vertical chemistry gradient with depth, it contains a chemocline. Temperature and salinity control ocean water density. Colder and saltier water is denser, and this density plays a crucial role in regulating the global water circulation within the ocean. [89] The halocline often coincides with the thermocline, and the combination produces a pronounced pycnocline, a boundary between less dense surface water and dense deep water.\\n\\nGrouped by distance from land The pelagic zone can be further subdivided into two sub regions based on distance from land: the neritic zone and the oceanic zone. The neritic zone covers the water directly above the continental shelves, including coastal waters. On the other hand, the oceanic zone includes all the completely open water.\\n\\nThe littoral zone covers the region between low and high tide and represents the transitional area between marine and terrestrial conditions. It is also known as the intertidal zone because it is the area where tide level affects the conditions of the region. [89]\\n\\nVolumes The combined volume of water in all the oceans is roughly 1.335 billion cubic kilometers (1.335 sextillion liters, 320.3 million cubic miles). [72][91][92]\\n\\nThis section is an excerpt from Hydrosphere. [edit] It has been estimated that there are 1.386 billion cubic kilometres (333 million cubic miles) of water on Earth. [93][94][95] This includes water in gaseous, liquid and frozen forms as soil moisture, groundwater and permafrost in the Earth\\'s crust (to a depth of 2 km); oceans and seas, lakes, rivers and streams, wetlands, glaciers, ice and snow cover on Earth\\'s surface; vapour, droplets and crystals in the air; and part of living plants, animals and unicellular organisms of the biosphere. Saltwater accounts for 97.5% of this amount, whereas fresh water accounts for only 2.5%. Of this fresh water, 68.9% is in the form of ice and permanent snow cover in the Arctic, the Antarctic and mountain glaciers; 30.8% is in the form of fresh groundwater; and only 0.3% of the fresh water on Earth is in easily accessible lakes, reservoirs and river systems. [96]\\n\\nThe total mass of Earth\\'s hydrosphere is about 1.4 × 1018 tonnes, which is about 0.023% of Earth\\'s total mass. At any given time, about 2 × 1013 tonnes of this is in the form of water vapor in the Earth\\'s atmosphere (for practical purposes, 1 cubic metre of water weighs 1 tonne). Approximately 71% of Earth\\'s surface, an area of some 361 million square kilometres (139.5 million square miles), is covered by ocean. The average salinity of Earth\\'s oceans is about 35 grams of salt per kilogram of sea water (3.5%). [97] Temperature Main articles: Ocean stratification, Ocean heat content, and Photic zone Ocean temperatures depends on the amount of solar radiation falling on its surface. In the tropics, with the Sun nearly overhead, the temperature of the surface layers can rise to over 30 °C (86 °F) while near the poles the temperature in equilibrium with the sea ice is about −2 °C (28 °F). There is a continuous circulation of water in the oceans. Warm surface currents cool as they move away from the tropics, and the water becomes denser and sinks. The cold water moves back towards the equator as a deep sea current, driven by changes in the temperature and density of the water, before eventually welling up again towards the surface. Deep ocean water has a temperature between −2 °C (28 °F) and 5 °C (41 °F) in all parts of the globe. [14]\\n\\nThe temperature gradient over the water depth is related to the way the surface water mixes with deeper water or does not mix (a lack of mixing is called ocean stratification). This depends on the temperature: in the tropics the warm surface layer of about 100 m is quite stable and does not mix much with deeper water, while near the poles winter cooling and storms makes the surface layer denser and it mixes to great depth and then stratifies again in summer. The photic depth is typically about 100 m (but varies) and is related to this heated surface layer. [98]\\n\\nThis section is an excerpt from Effects of climate change on oceans § Rising ocean temperature. [edit] It is clear that the ocean is warming as a result of climate change, and this rate of warming is increasing. [99]:\\u200a9\\u200a The global ocean was the warmest it had ever been recorded by humans in 2022. [100] This is determined by the ocean heat content, which exceeded the previous 2021 maximum in 2022. [100] The steady rise in ocean temperatures is an unavoidable result of the Earth\\'s energy imbalance, which is primarily caused by rising levels of greenhouse gases. [100] Between pre-industrial times and the 2011–2020 decade, the ocean\\'s surface has heated between 0.68 and 1.01 °C. [101]:\\u200a1214 Temperature and salinity by region The temperature and salinity of ocean waters vary significantly across different regions. This is due to differences in the local water balance (precipitation vs. evaporation) and the \"sea to air\" temperature gradients. These characteristics can vary widely from one ocean region to another. The table below provides an illustration of the sort of values usually encountered.\\n\\nGeneral characteristics of ocean surface waters by region[102][103][104][105][106] Characteristic\\tPolar regions\\tTemperate regions\\tTropical regions Precipitation vs. evaporation\\tPrecip > Evap\\tPrecip > Evap\\tEvap > Precip Sea surface temperature in winter\\t−2 °C\\t5 to 20 °C\\t20 to 25 °C Average salinity\\t28‰ to 32‰\\t35‰\\t35‰ to 37‰ Annual variation of air temperature\\t≤ 40 °C\\t10 °C\\t< 5 °C Annual variation of water temperature\\t< 5 °C\\t10 °C\\t< 5 °C Sea ice Main articles: Sea ice and Arctic sea ice decline Seawater with a typical salinity of 35‰ has a freezing point of about −1.8 °C (28.8 °F). [89][107] Because sea ice is less dense than water, it floats on the ocean\\'s surface (as does fresh water ice, which has an even lower density). Sea ice covers about 7% of the Earth\\'s surface and about 12% of the world\\'s oceans. [108][109][110] Sea ice usually starts to freeze at the very surface, initially as a very thin ice film. As further freezing takes place, this ice film thickens and can form ice sheets. The ice formed incorporates some sea salt, but much less than the seawater it forms from. As the ice forms with low salinity this results in saltier residual seawater. This in turn increases density and promotes vertical sinking of the water. [111]\\n\\nOcean currents and global climate Further information: Ocean current, Thermohaline circulation, and Ocean general circulation model\\n\\nOcean surface currents World map with colored, directed lines showing how water moves through the oceans. Cold deep water rises and warms in the central Pacific and in the Indian, whereas warm water sinks and cools near Greenland in the North Atlantic and near Antarctica in the South Atlantic. A map of the global thermohaline circulation; blue represents deep-water currents, whereas red represents surface currents. See also: Effects of climate change on oceans § Changing ocean currents Types of ocean currents An ocean current is a continuous, directed flow of seawater caused by several forces acting upon the water. These include wind, the Coriolis effect, temperature and salinity differences. [15] Ocean currents are primarily horizontal water movements that have different origins such as tides for tidal currents, or wind and waves for surface currents.\\n\\nTidal currents are in phase with the tide, hence are quasiperiodic; associated with the influence of the moon and sun pull on the ocean water. Tidal currents may form various complex patterns in certain places, most notably around headlands. [112] Non-periodic or non-tidal currents are created by the action of winds and changes in density of water. In littoral zones, breaking waves are so intense and the depth measurement so low, that maritime currents reach often 1 to 2 knots. [113]\\n\\nThe wind and waves create surface currents (designated as \"drift currents\"). These currents can decompose in one quasi-permanent current (which varies within the hourly scale) and one movement of Stokes drift under the effect of rapid waves movement (which vary on timescales of a couple of seconds). The quasi-permanent current is accelerated by the breaking of waves, and in a lesser governing effect, by the friction of the wind on the surface. [113]\\n\\nThis acceleration of the current takes place in the direction of waves and dominant wind. Accordingly, when the ocean depth increases, the rotation of the earth changes the direction of currents in proportion with the increase of depth, while friction lowers their speed. At a certain ocean depth, the current changes direction and is seen inverted in the opposite direction with current speed becoming null: known as the Ekman spiral. The influence of these currents is mainly experienced at the mixed layer of the ocean surface, often from 400 to 800 meters of maximum depth. These currents can considerably change and are dependent on the yearly seasons. If the mixed layer is less thick (10 to 20 meters), the quasi-permanent current at the surface can adopt quite a different direction in relation to the direction of the wind. In this case, the water column becomes virtually homogeneous above the thermocline. [113]\\n\\nThe wind blowing on the ocean surface will set the water in motion. The global pattern of winds (also called atmospheric circulation) creates a global pattern of ocean currents. These are driven not only by the wind but also by the effect of the circulation of the earth (coriolis force). These major ocean currents include the Gulf Stream, Kuroshio current, Agulhas current and Antarctic Circumpolar Current. The Antarctic Circumpolar Current encircles Antarctica and influences the area\\'s climate, connecting currents in several oceans. [113]\\n\\nRelationship of currents and climate Main article: Atlantic meridional overturning circulation\\n\\nMap of the Gulf Stream, a major ocean current that transports heat from the equator to northern latitudes and moderates the climate of Europe. Collectively, currents move enormous amounts of water and heat around the globe influencing climate. These wind driven currents are largely confined to the top hundreds of meters of the ocean. At greater depth, the thermohaline circulation (Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC), which is part of a global thermoholine circulation, drives water motion.The AMOC is driven by the cooling of surface waters in the polar latitudes in the north and south, creating dense water which sinks to the bottom of the ocean. This cold and dense water moves slowly away from the poles which is why the waters in the deepest layers of the world ocean are so cold. This deep ocean water circulation is relatively slow and water at the bottom of the ocean can be isolated from the ocean surface and atmosphere for hundreds or even a few thousand years. [113] This circulation has important impacts on global climate and the uptake and redistribution of pollutants such as carbon dioxide by moving these contaminants from the surface into the deep ocean.\\n\\nOcean currents greatly affect Earth\\'s climate by transferring heat from the tropics to the pol', metadata={'source': 'stor\\\\untitled.txt'})]"

       "[Document(page_content='The world ocean or ocean sea is the body of salt water that covers ~70.8% of the Earth. [8] In English, the term ocean also refers to any of the large bodies of water into which the world ocean is conventionally divided. [9] Distinct names are used to identify five different areas of the ocean: Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Antarctic/Southern, and Arctic. [10][11] The ocean contains 97% of Earth\\'s water[8] and is the primary component of the Earth\\'s hydrosphere, thus the ocean is essential to life on Earth. The ocean influences climate and weather patterns, the carbon cycle, and the water cycle by acting as a huge heat reservoir.\\n\\nOceanographers split the ocean into vertical and horizontal zones based on physical and biological conditions. The pelagic zone is the open ocean\\'s water column from the surface to the ocean floor. The water column is further divided into zones based on depth and the amount of light present. The photic zone starts at the surface and is defined to be \"the depth at which light intensity is only 1% of the surface value\"[12]:\\u200a36\\u200a (approximately 200 m in the open ocean). This is the zone where photosynthesis can occur. In this process plants and microscopic algae (free floating phytoplankton) use light, water, carbon dioxide, and nutrients to produce organic matter. As a result, the photic zone is the most biodiverse and the source of the food supply which sustains most of the ocean ecosystem. Ocean photosynthesis also produces half of the oxygen in the Earth\\'s atmosphere. [13] Light can only penetrate a few hundred more meters; the rest of the deeper ocean is cold and dark (these zones are called mesopelagic and aphotic zones). The continental shelf is where the ocean meets dry land. It is more shallow, with a depth of a few hundred meters or less. Human activity often has negative impacts on the ecosystems within the continental shelf.\\n\\nOcean temperatures depend on the amount of solar radiation reaching the ocean surface. In the tropics, surface temperatures can rise to over 30 °C (86 °F). Near the poles where sea ice forms, the temperature in equilibrium is about −2 °C (28 °F). In all parts of the ocean, deep ocean temperatures range between −2 °C (28 °F) and 5 °C (41 °F). [14] Constant circulation of water in the ocean creates ocean currents. These directed movements of seawater are caused by forces operating on the water, such as temperature variations, atmospheric circulation (wind), the Coriolis effect and salinity changes. [15] Tides create tidal currents, while wind and waves cause surface currents. The Gulf Stream, Kuroshio Current, Agulhas Current and Antarctic Circumpolar Current are all major ocean currents. Currents transport massive amounts of water and heat around the world. By transporting these pollutants from the surface into the deep ocean, this circulation impacts global climate and the uptake and redistribution of pollutants such as carbon dioxide.\\n\\nOcean water contains a high concentration of dissolved gases, including oxygen, carbon dioxide and nitrogen. This gas exchange occurs at the ocean\\'s surface and solubility depends on the temperature and salinity of the water. [16] Carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere rises due to fossil fuel combustion, which causes higher levels in ocean water, resulting in ocean acidification. [17] The ocean provides crucial environmental services to humankind, such as climate regulation. It also provides a means of trade and transport as well as access to food and other resources. It is known to be the habitat of over 230,000 species, but may hold considerably more – perhaps over two million species. [18] However, the ocean faces numerous human-caused environmental threats, such as marine pollution, overfishing, and effects of climate change on oceans such as ocean warming, ocean acidification and sea level rise. The continental shelf and coastal waters that are most affected by human activity are particularly vulnerable.\\n\\nTerminology Ocean and sea The terms \"the ocean\" or \"the sea\" used without specification refer to the interconnected body of salt water covering the majority of the Earth\\'s surface. [10][11] It includes the Atlantic, Pacific, Indian, Antarctic/Southern and Arctic Oceans. [19] As a general term, \"the ocean\" and \"the sea\" are often interchangeable, although speakers of British English refer to \"the sea\" in all cases,[20][dubious – discuss] even when the body of water is one of the oceans.\\n\\nStrictly speaking, a \"sea\" is a body of water (generally a division of the world ocean) partly or fully enclosed by land. [21] The word \"sea\" can also be used for many specific, much smaller bodies of seawater, such as the North Sea or the Red Sea. There is no sharp distinction between seas and oceans, though generally seas are smaller, and are often partly (as marginal seas) or wholly (as inland seas) bordered by land. [22]\\n\\nWorld ocean \"World Ocean\" redirects here. Not to be confused with Ocean World. The contemporary concept of the World Ocean was coined in the early 20th century by the Russian oceanographer Yuly Shokalsky to refer to the continuous ocean that covers and encircles most of the Earth. [23][24] The global, interconnected body of salt water is sometimes referred to as the World Ocean, global ocean or the great ocean. [25][26][27] The concept of a continuous body of water with relatively unrestricted exchange between its components is critical in oceanography. [28]\\n\\nEtymology The word ocean comes from the figure in classical antiquity, Oceanus (/oʊˈsiːənəs/; Greek: Ὠκεανός Ōkeanós,[29] pronounced [ɔːkeanós]), the elder of the Titans in classical Greek mythology. Oceanus was believed by the ancient Greeks and Romans to be the divine personification of an enormous river encircling the world.\\n\\nThe concept of Ōkeanós has an Indo-European connection. Greek Ōkeanós has been compared to the Vedic epithet ā-śáyāna-, predicated of the dragon Vṛtra-, who captured the cows/rivers. Related to this notion, the Okeanos is represented with a dragon-tail on some early Greek vases. [30]\\n\\nNatural history Further information: List of ancient oceans Origin of water Further information: Origin of water on Earth Scientists believe that a sizable quantity of water would have been in the material that formed Earth. [31] Water molecules would have escaped Earth\\'s gravity more easily when it was less massive during its formation. This is called atmospheric escape.\\n\\nDuring planetary formation, Earth possibly had magma oceans. Subsequently, outgassing, volcanic activity and meteorite impacts, produced an early atmosphere of carbon dioxide, nitrogen and water vapor, according to current theories. The gases and the atmosphere are thought to have accumulated over millions of years. After Earth\\'s surface had significantly cooled, the water vapor over time would have condensed, forming Earth\\'s first oceans. [32] The early oceans might have been significantly hotter than today and appeared green due to high iron content. [33]\\n\\nGeological evidence helps constrain the time frame for liquid water existing on Earth. A sample of pillow basalt (a type of rock formed during an underwater eruption) was recovered from the Isua Greenstone Belt and provides evidence that water existed on Earth 3.8 billion years ago. [34] In the Nuvvuagittuq Greenstone Belt, Quebec, Canada, rocks dated at 3.8 billion years old by one study[35] and 4.28 billion years old by another[36] show evidence of the presence of water at these ages. [34] If oceans existed earlier than this, any geological evidence either has yet to be discovered, or has since been destroyed by geological processes like crustal recycling. However, in August 2020, researchers reported that sufficient water to fill the oceans may have always been on the Earth since the beginning of the planet\\'s formation. [37][38][39] In this model, atmospheric greenhouse gases kept the oceans from freezing when the newly forming Sun had only 70% of its current luminosity. [40]\\n\\nOcean formation Main article: Paleoceanography The origin of Earth\\'s oceans is unknown. Oceans are thought to have formed in the Hadean eon and may have been the cause for the emergence of life.\\n\\nPlate tectonics, post-glacial rebound, and sea level rise continually change the coastline and structure of the world ocean. A global ocean has existed in one form or another on Earth for eons.\\n\\nSince its formation the ocean has taken many conditions and shapes with many past ocean divisions and potentially at times covering the whole globe. [41]\\n\\nDuring colder climatic periods, more ice caps and glaciers form, and enough of the global water supply accumulates as ice to lessen the amounts in other parts of the water cycle. The reverse is true during warm periods. During the last ice age, glaciers covered almost one-third of Earth\\'s land mass with the result being that the oceans were about 122 m (400 ft) lower than today. During the last global \"warm spell,\" about 125,000 years ago, the seas were about 5.5 m (18 ft) higher than they are now. About three million years ago the oceans could have been up to 50 m (165 ft) higher. [42]\\n\\nGeography Further information: Water distribution on Earth\\n\\nWorld map of the five-ocean model with approximate boundaries The entire ocean, containing 97% of Earth\\'s water, spans 70.8% of Earth\\'s surface,[8] making it Earth\\'s global ocean or world ocean. [23][25] This makes Earth, along with its vibrant hydrosphere a \"water world\"[43][44] or \"ocean world\",[45][46] particularly in Earth\\'s early history when the ocean is thought to have possibly covered Earth completely. [41] The ocean\\'s shape is irregular, unevenly dominating the Earth\\'s surface. This leads to the distinction of the Earth\\'s surface into a water and land hemisphere, as well as the division of the ocean into different oceans.\\n\\nSeawater covers about 361,000,000 km2 (139,000,000 sq mi) and the Ocean\\'s furthest pole of inaccessibility, known as \"Point Nemo\", in a region known as spacecraft cemetery of the South Pacific Ocean, at 48°52.6′S 123°23.6′W. This point is roughly 2,688 km (1,670 mi) from the nearest land.

Earth\\'s oceanic basins cover different geologic provinces of Earth\\'s oceanic crust as well as continental crust. As such it covers mainly Earth\\'s structural basins, but also continental shelfs.\\n\\nIn mid-ocean, magma is constantly being thrust through the seabed between adjoining plates to form mid-oceanic ridges and here convection currents within the mantle tend to drive the two plates apart. Parallel to these ridges and nearer the coasts, one oceanic plate may slide beneath another oceanic plate in a process known as subduction. Deep trenches are formed here and the process is accompanied by friction as the plates grind together. The movement proceeds in jerks which cause earthquakes, heat is produced and magma is forced up creating underwater mountains, some of which may form chains of volcanic islands near to deep trenches. Near some of the boundaries between the land and sea, the slightly denser oceanic plates slide beneath the continental plates and more subduction trenches are formed. As they grate together, the continental plates are deformed and buckle causing mountain building and seismic activity. [57][58]\\n\\nEvery ocean basin has a mid-ocean ridge, which creates a long mountain range beneath the ocean. Together they form the global mid-oceanic ridge system that features the longest mountain range in the world. The longest continuous mountain range is 65,000 km (40,000 mi). This underwater mountain range is several times longer than the longest continental mountain range – the Andes. [59]\\n\\nOceanographers state that less than 20% of the oceans have been mapped. [60][vague]\\n\\nInteraction with the coast\\n\\nMain article: Coast\\n\\nPraia da Marinha in Algarve, Portugal The zone where land meets sea is known as the coast and the part between the lowest spring tides and the upper limit reached by splashing waves is the shore. A beach is the accumulation of sand or shingle on the shore. [61] A headland is a point of land jutting out into the sea and a larger promontory is known as a cape. The indentation of a coastline, especially between two headlands, is a bay, a small bay with a narrow inlet is a cove and a large bay may be referred to as a gulf. [62] Coastlines are influenced by several factors including the strength of the waves arriving on the shore, the gradient of the land margin, the composition and hardness of the coastal rock, the inclination of the off-shore slope and the changes of the level of the land due to local uplift or submergence. [61]\\n\\nNormally, waves roll towards the shore at the rate of six to eight per minute and these are known as constructive waves as they tend to move material up the beach and have little erosive effect. Storm waves arrive on shore in rapid succession and are known as destructive waves as the swash moves beach material seawards. Under their influence, the sand and shingle on the beach is ground together and abraded. Around high tide, the power of a storm wave impacting on the foot of a cliff has a shattering effect as air in cracks and crevices is compressed and then expands rapidly with release of pressure. At the same time, sand and pebbles have an erosive effect as they are thrown against the rocks. This tends to undercut the cliff, and normal weathering processes such as the action of frost follows, causing further destruction. Gradually, a wave-cut platform develops at the foot of the cliff and this has a protective effect, reducing further wave-erosion. [61]\\n\\nMaterial worn from the margins of the land eventually ends up in the sea. Here it is subject to attrition as currents flowing parallel to the coast scour out channels and transport sand and pebbles away from their place of origin. Sediment carried to the sea by rivers settles on the seabed causing deltas to form in estuaries. All these materials move back and forth under the influence of waves, tides and currents. [61] Dredging removes material and deepens channels but may have unexpected effects elsewhere on the coastline. Governments make efforts to prevent flooding of the land by the building of breakwaters, seawalls, dykes and levees and other sea defences. For instance, the Thames Barrier is designed to protect London from a storm surge,[63] while the failure of the dykes and levees around New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina created a humanitarian crisis in the United States.\\n\\nPhysical properties\\n\\nColor\\n\\nOcean chlorophyll concentration is a proxy for phytoplankton biomass. In this map, blue colors represent lower chlorophyll and reds represent higher chlorophyll. Satellite-measured chlorophyll is estimated based on ocean color by how green the color of the water appears from space. This section is an excerpt from Ocean color. [edit] Most of the ocean is blue in color, but in some places the ocean is blue-green, green, or even yellow to brown. [64] Blue ocean color is a result of several factors. First, water preferentially absorbs red light, which means that blue light remains and is reflected back out of the water. Red light is most easily absorbed and thus does not reach great depths, usually to less than 50 meters (164 ft). Blue light, in comparison, can penetrate up to 200 meters (656 ft). [65] Second, water molecules and very tiny particles in ocean water preferentially scatter blue light more than light of other colors. Blue light scattering by water and tiny particles happens even in the very clearest ocean water,[66] and is similar to blue light scattering in the sky.\\n\\nThe main substances that affect the color of the ocean include dissolved organic matter, living phytoplankton with chlorophyll pigments, and non-living particles like marine snow and mineral sediments. [67] Chlorophyll can be measured by satellite observations and serves as a proxy for ocean productivity (marine primary productivity) in surface waters. In long term composite satellite images, regions with high ocean productivity show up in yellow and green colors because they contain more (green) phytoplankton, whereas areas of low productivity show up in blue. Water cycle, weather and rainfall Further information: Effects of climate change on the water cycle and Water distribution on Earth\\n\\nThe ocean is a major driver of Earth\\'s water cycle. Ocean water represents the largest body of water within the global water cycle (oceans contain 97% of Earth\\'s water). Evaporation from the ocean moves water into the atmosphere to later rain back down onto land and the ocean. [68] Oceans have a significant effect on the biosphere. The ocean as a whole is thought to cover approximately 90% of the Earth\\'s biosphere. [60] Oceanic evaporation, as a phase of the water cycle, is the source of most rainfall (about 90%),[68] causing a global cloud cover of 67% and a consistent oceanic cloud cover of 72%. [69] Ocean temperatures affect climate and wind patterns that affect life on land. One of the most dramatic forms of weather occurs over the oceans: tropical cyclones (also called \"typhoons\" and \"hurricanes\" depending upon where the system forms).\\n\\nAs the world\\'s ocean is the principal component of Earth\\'s hydrosphere, it is integral to life on Earth, forms part of the carbon cycle and water cycle, and – as a huge heat reservoir – influences climate and weather patterns.\\n\\nWaves and swell Duration: 13 seconds.0:13 Movement of water as waves pass Main articles: Wind wave and Swell (ocean) The motions of the ocean surface, known as undulations or wind waves, are the partial and alternate rising and falling of the ocean surface. The series of mechanical waves that propagate along the interface between water and air is called swell – a term used in sailing, surfing and navigation. [70] These motions profoundly affect ships on the surface of the ocean and the well-being of people on those ships who might suffer from sea sickness.\\n\\nWind blowing over the surface of a body of water forms waves that are perpendicular to the direction of the wind. The friction between air and water caused by a gentle breeze on a pond causes ripples to form. A strong blow over the ocean causes larger waves as the moving air pushes against the raised ridges of water. The waves reach their maximum height when the rate at which they are travelling nearly matches the speed of the wind. In open water, when the wind blows continuously as happens in the Southern Hemisphere in the Roaring Forties, long, organized masses of water called swell roll across the ocean. [71]:\\u200a83–84\\u200a[72][73] If the wind dies down, the wave formation is reduced, but already-formed waves continue to travel in their original direction until they meet land. The size of the waves depends on the fetch, the distance that the wind has blown over the water and the strength and duration of that wind. When waves meet others coming from different directions, interference between the two can produce broken, irregular seas. [72]\\n\\nConstructive interference can lead to the formation of unusually high rogue waves. [74] Most waves are less than 3 m (10 ft) high[74] and it is not unusual for strong storms to double or triple that height. [75] Rogue waves, however, have been documented at heights above 25 meters (82 ft). [76][77]\\n\\nThe top of a wave is known as the crest, the lowest point between waves is the trough and the distance between the crests is the wavelength. The wave is pushed across the surface of the ocean by the wind, but this represents a transfer of energy and not horizontal movement of water. As waves approach land and move into shallow water, they change their behavior. If approaching at an angle, waves may bend (refraction) or wrap around rocks and headlands (diffraction). When the wave reaches a point where its deepest oscillations of the water contact the ocean floor, they begin to slow down. This pulls the crests closer together and increases the waves\\' height, which is called wave shoaling. When the ratio of the wave\\'s height to the water depth increases above a certain limit, it \"breaks\", toppling over in a mass of foaming water. [74] This rushes in a sheet up the beach before retreating into the ocean under the influence of gravity. [78]\\n\\nEarthquakes, volcanic eruptions or other major geological disturbances can set off waves that can lead to tsunamis in coastal areas which can be very dangerous. [79][80]\\n\\nSea level and surface Further information: Sea level and Sea level rise The ocean\\'s surface is an important reference point for oceanography and geography, particularly as mean sea level. The ocean surface has globally little, but measurable topography, depending on the ocean\\'s volumes.\\n\\nThe ocean surface is a crucial interface for oceanic and atmospheric processes. Allowing interchange of particles, enriching the air and water, as well as grounds by some particles becoming sediments. This interchange has fertilized life in the ocean, on land and air. All these processes and components together make up ocean surface ecosystems.\\n\\nTides\\n\\nMain article: Tide\\n\\nHigh tide and low tide in the Bay of Fundy, Canada. Tides are the regular rise and fall in water level experienced by oceans, primarily driven by the Moon\\'s gravitational tidal forces upon the Earth. Tidal forces affect all matter on Earth, but only fluids like the ocean demonstrate the effects on human timescales. (For example, tidal forces acting on rock may produce tidal locking between two planetary bodies.) Though primarily driven by the Moon\\'s gravity, oceanic tides are also substantially modulated by the Sun\\'s tidal forces, by the rotation of the Earth, and by the shape of the rocky continents blocking oceanic water flow. (Tidal forces vary more with distance than the \"base\" force of gravity: the Moon\\'s tidal forces on Earth are more than double the Sun\\'s,[81] despite the latter\\'s much stronger gravitational force on Earth. Earth\\'s tidal forces upon the Moon are 20x stronger than the Moon\\'s tidal forces on the Earth.)\\n\\nThe primary effect of lunar tidal forces is to bulge Earth matter towards the near and far sides of the Earth, relative to the moon. The \"perpendicular\" sides, from which the Moon appears in line with the local horizon, experience \"tidal troughs\". Since it takes nearly 25 hours for the Earth to rotate under the Moon (accounting for the Moon\\'s 28 day orbit around Earth), tides thus cycle over a course of 12.5 hours. However, the rocky continents pose obstacles for the tidal bulges, so the timing of tidal maxima may not actually align with the Moon in most localities on Earth, as the oceans are forced to \"dodge\" the continents. Timing and magnitude of tides vary widely across the Earth as a result of the continents. Thus, knowing the Moon\\'s position does not allow a local to predict tide timings, instead requiring precomputed tide tables which account for the continents and the Sun, among others.\\n\\nDuring each tidal cycle, at any given place the tidal waters rise to maximum height, high tide, before ebbing away again to the minimum level, low tide. As the water recedes, it gradually reveals the foreshore, also known as the intertidal zone. The difference in height between the high tide and low tide is known as the tidal range or tidal amplitude. [82][83] When the sun and moon are aligned (full moon or new moon), the combined effect results in the higher \"spring tides\", while the sun and moon misaligning (half moons) result in lesser tidal ranges. [82]\\n\\nIn the open ocean tidal ranges are less than 1 meter, but in coastal areas these tidal ranges increase to more than 10 meters in some areas. [84] Some of the largest tidal ranges in the world occur in the Bay of Fundy and Ungava Bay in Canada, reaching up to 16 meters. [85] Other locations with record high tidal ranges include the Bristol Channel between England and Wales, Cook Inlet in Alaska, and the Río Gallegos in Argentina. [86]\\n\\nTides are not to be confused with storm surges, which can occur when high winds pile water up against the coast in a shallow area and this, coupled with a low pressure system, can raise the surface of the ocean dramatically above a typical high tide.\\n\\nDepth Further information: Bathymetry The average depth of the oceans is about 4 km. More precisely the average depth is 3,688 meters (12,100 ft). [72] Nearly half of the world\\'s marine waters are over 3,000 meters (9,800 ft) deep. [27] \"Deep ocean,\" which is anything below 200 meters (660 ft), covers about 66% of Earth\\'s surface. [87] This figure does not include seas not connected to the World Ocean, such as the Caspian Sea.\\n\\nThe deepest region of the ocean is at the Mariana Trench, located in the Pacific Ocean near the Northern Mariana Islands. [88] The maximum depth has been estimated to be 10,971 meters (35,994 ft). The British naval vessel Challenger II surveyed the trench in 1951 and named the deepest part of the trench the \"Challenger Deep\". In 1960, the Trieste successfully reached the bottom of the trench, manned by a crew of two men.\\n\\nOceanic zones Further information: Ocean stratification Drawing showing divisions according to depth and distance from shore The major oceanic zones, based on depth and biophysical conditions Oceanographers classify the ocean into vertical and horizontal zones based on physical and biological conditions. The pelagic zone consists of the water column of the open ocean, and can be divided into further regions categorized by light abundance and by depth.\\n\\nGrouped by light penetration Further information: Photic zone, Mesopelagic zone, and Aphotic zone The ocean zones can be grouped by light penetration into (from top to bottom): the photic zone, the mesopelagic zone and the aphotic deep ocean zone:\\n\\nThe photic zone is defined to be \"the depth at which light intensity is only 1% of the surface value\". [12]:\\u200a36\\u200a This is usually up to a depth of approximately 200 m in the open ocean. It is the region where photosynthesis can occur and is, therefore, the most biodiverse. Photosynthesis by plants and microscopic algae (free floating phytoplankton) allows the creation of organic matter from chemical precursors including water and carbon dioxide. This organic matter can then be consumed by other creatures. Much of the organic matter created in the photic zone is consumed there but some sinks into deeper waters. The pelagic part of the photic zone is known as the epipelagic. [89] The actual optics of light reflecting and penetrating at the ocean surface are complex. [12]:\\u200a34–39 Below the photic zone is the mesopelagic or twilight zone where there is a very small amount of light. The basic concept is that with that little light photosynthesis is unlikely to achieve any net growth over respiration. [12]:\\u200a116–124 Below that is the aphotic deep ocean to which no surface sunlight at all penetrates. Life that exists deeper than the photic zone must either rely on material sinking from above (see marine snow) or find another energy source. Hydrothermal vents are a source of energy in what is known as the aphotic zone (depths exceeding 200 m).\\n\\n[89] Grouped by depth and temperature The pelagic part of the aphotic zone can be further divided into vertical regions according to depth and temperature:[89]\\n\\nThe mesopelagic is the uppermost region. Its lowermost boundary is at a thermocline of 12 °C (54 °F) which generally lies at 700–1,000 meters (2,300–3,300 ft) in the tropics. Next is the bathypelagic lying between 10 and 4 °C (50 and 39 °F), typically between 700–1,000 meters (2,300–3,300 ft) and 2,000–4,000 meters (6,600–13,100 ft). Lying along the top of the abyssal plain is the abyssopelagic, whose lower boundary lies at about 6,000 meters (20,000 ft). The last and deepest zone is the hadalpelagic which includes the oceanic trench and lies between 6,000–11,000 meters (20,000–36,000 ft). The benthic zones are aphotic and correspond to the three deepest zones of the deep-sea. The bathyal zone covers the continental slope down to about 4,000 meters (13,000 ft). The abyssal zone covers the abyssal plains between 4,000 and 6,000 m. Lastly, the hadal zone corresponds to the hadalpelagic zone, which is found in oceanic trenches. Distinct boundaries between ocean surface waters and deep waters can be drawn based on the properties of the water. These boundaries are called thermoclines (temperature), haloclines (salinity), chemoclines (chemistry), and pycnoclines (density). If a zone undergoes dramatic changes in temperature with depth, it contains a thermocline, a distinct boundary between warmer surface water and colder deep water. In tropical regions, the thermocline is typically deeper compared to higher latitudes.\\n\\nUnlike polar waters, where solar energy input is limited, temperature stratification is less pronounced, and a distinct thermocline is often absent. This is due to the fact that surface waters in polar latitudes are nearly as cold as deeper waters. Below the thermocline, water everywhere in the ocean is very cold, ranging from −1 °C to 3 °C. Because this deep and cold layer contains the bulk of ocean water, the average temperature of the world ocean is 3.9 °C. [90] If a zone undergoes dramatic changes in salinity with depth, it contains a halocline. If a zone undergoes a strong, vertical chemistry gradient with depth, it contains a chemocline. Temperature and salinity control ocean water density. Colder and saltier water is denser, and this density plays a crucial role in regulating the global water circulation within the ocean. [89] The halocline often coincides with the thermocline, and the combination produces a pronounced pycnocline, a boundary between less dense surface water and dense deep water.\\n\\nGrouped by distance from land The pelagic zone can be further subdivided into two sub regions based on distance from land: the neritic zone and the oceanic zone. The neritic zone covers the water directly above the continental shelves, including coastal waters. On the other hand, the oceanic zone includes all the completely open water.\\n\\nThe littoral zone covers the region between low and high tide and represents the transitional area between marine and terrestrial conditions. It is also known as the intertidal zone because it is the area where tide level affects the conditions of the region. [89]\\n\\nVolumes The combined volume of water in all the oceans is roughly 1.335 billion cubic kilometers (1.335 sextillion liters, 320.3 million cubic miles). [72][91][92]\\n\\nThis section is an excerpt from Hydrosphere. [edit] It has been estimated that there are 1.386 billion cubic kilometres (333 million cubic miles) of water on Earth. [93][94][95] This includes water in gaseous, liquid and frozen forms as soil moisture, groundwater and permafrost in the Earth\\'s crust (to a depth of 2 km); oceans and seas, lakes, rivers and streams, wetlands, glaciers, ice and snow cover on Earth\\'s surface; vapour, droplets and crystals in the air; and part of living plants, animals and unicellular organisms of the biosphere. Saltwater accounts for 97.5% of this amount, whereas fresh water accounts for only 2.5%. Of this fresh water, 68.9% is in the form of ice and permanent snow cover in the Arctic, the Antarctic and mountain glaciers; 30.8% is in the form of fresh groundwater; and only 0.3% of the fresh water on Earth is in easily accessible lakes, reservoirs and river systems. [96]\\n\\nThe total mass of Earth\\'s hydrosphere is about 1.4 × 1018 tonnes, which is about 0.023% of Earth\\'s total mass. At any given time, about 2 × 1013 tonnes of this is in the form of water vapor in the Earth\\'s atmosphere (for practical purposes, 1 cubic metre of water weighs 1 tonne). Approximately 71% of Earth\\'s surface, an area of some 361 million square kilometres (139.5 million square miles), is covered by ocean. The average salinity of Earth\\'s oceans is about 35 grams of salt per kilogram of sea water (3.5%). [97] Temperature Main articles: Ocean stratification, Ocean heat content, and Photic zone Ocean temperatures depends on the amount of solar radiation falling on its surface. In the tropics, with the Sun nearly overhead, the temperature of the surface layers can rise to over 30 °C (86 °F) while near the poles the temperature in equilibrium with the sea ice is about −2 °C (28 °F). There is a continuous circulation of water in the oceans. Warm surface currents cool as they move away from the tropics, and the water becomes denser and sinks. The cold water moves back towards the equator as a deep sea current, driven by changes in the temperature and density of the water, before eventually welling up again towards the surface. Deep ocean water has a temperature between −2 °C (28 °F) and 5 °C (41 °F) in all parts of the globe. [14]\\n\\nThe temperature gradient over the water depth is related to the way the surface water mixes with deeper water or does not mix (a lack of mixing is called ocean stratification). This depends on the temperature: in the tropics the warm surface layer of about 100 m is quite stable and does not mix much with deeper water, while near the poles winter cooling and storms makes the surface layer denser and it mixes to great depth and then stratifies again in summer. The photic depth is typically about 100 m (but varies) and is related to this heated surface layer. [98]\\n\\nThis section is an excerpt from Effects of climate change on oceans § Rising ocean temperature. [edit] It is clear that the ocean is warming as a result of climate change, and this rate of warming is increasing. [99]:\\u200a9\\u200a The global ocean was the warmest it had ever been recorded by humans in 2022. [100] This is determined by the ocean heat content, which exceeded the previous 2021 maximum in 2022. [100] The steady rise in ocean temperatures is an unavoidable result of the Earth\\'s energy imbalance, which is primarily caused by rising levels of greenhouse gases. [100] Between pre-industrial times and the 2011–2020 decade, the ocean\\'s surface has heated between 0.68 and 1.01 °C. [101]:\\u200a1214 Temperature and salinity by region The temperature and salinity of ocean waters vary significantly across different regions. This is due to differences in the local water balance (precipitation vs. evaporation) and the \"sea to air\" temperature gradients. These characteristics can vary widely from one ocean region to another. The table below provides an illustration of the sort of values usually encountered.\\n\\nGeneral characteristics of ocean surface waters by region[102][103][104][105][106] Characteristic\\tPolar regions\\tTemperate regions\\tTropical regions Precipitation vs. evaporation\\tPrecip > Evap\\tPrecip > Evap\\tEvap > Precip Sea surface temperature in winter\\t−2 °C\\t5 to 20 °C\\t20 to 25 °C Average salinity\\t28‰ to 32‰\\t35‰\\t35‰ to 37‰ Annual variation of air temperature\\t≤ 40 °C\\t10 °C\\t< 5 °C Annual variation of water temperature\\t< 5 °C\\t10 °C\\t< 5 °C Sea ice Main articles: Sea ice and Arctic sea ice decline Seawater with a typical salinity of 35‰ has a freezing point of about −1.8 °C (28.8 °F). [89][107] Because sea ice is less dense than water, it floats on the ocean\\'s surface (as does fresh water ice, which has an even lower density). Sea ice covers about 7% of the Earth\\'s surface and about 12% of the world\\'s oceans. [108][109][110] Sea ice usually starts to freeze at the very surface, initially as a very thin ice film. As further freezing takes place, this ice film thickens and can form ice sheets. The ice formed incorporates some sea salt, but much less than the seawater it forms from. As the ice forms with low salinity this results in saltier residual seawater. This in turn increases density and promotes vertical sinking of the water.

See also: Effects of climate change on oceans § Changing ocean currents Types of ocean currents An ocean current is a continuous, directed flow of seawater caused by several forces acting upon the water. These include wind, the Coriolis effect, temperature and salinity differences. [15] Ocean currents are primarily horizontal water movements that have different origins such as tides for tidal currents, or wind and waves for surface currents.\\n\\nTidal currents are in phase with the tide, hence are quasiperiodic; associated with the influence of the moon and sun pull on the ocean water. Tidal currents may form various complex patterns in certain places, most notably around headlands. [112] Non-periodic or non-tidal currents are created by the action of winds and changes in density of water. In littoral zones, breaking waves are so intense and the depth measurement so low, that maritime currents reach often 1 to 2 knots. [113]\\n\\nThe wind and waves create surface currents (designated as \"drift currents\"). These currents can decompose in one quasi-permanent current (which varies within the hourly scale) and one movement of Stokes drift under the effect of rapid waves movement (which vary on timescales of a couple of seconds). The quasi-permanent current is accelerated by the breaking of waves, and in a lesser governing effect, by the friction of the wind on the surface. [113]\\n\\nThis acceleration of the current takes place in the direction of waves and dominant wind. Accordingly, when the ocean depth increases, the rotation of the earth changes the direction of currents in proportion with the increase of depth, while friction lowers their speed. At a certain ocean depth, the current changes direction and is seen inverted in the opposite direction with current speed becoming null: known as the Ekman spiral. The influence of these currents is mainly experienced at the mixed layer of the ocean surface, often from 400 to 800 meters of maximum depth. These currents can considerably change and are dependent on the yearly seasons. If the mixed layer is less thick (10 to 20 meters), the quasi-permanent current at the surface can adopt quite a different direction in relation to the direction of the wind. In this case, the water column becomes virtually homogeneous above the thermocline. [113]\\n\\nThe wind blowing on the ocean surface will set the water in motion. The global pattern of winds (also called atmospheric circulation) creates a global pattern of ocean currents. These are driven not only by the wind but also by the effect of the circulation of the earth (coriolis force). These major ocean currents include the Gulf Stream, Kuroshio current, Agulhas current and Antarctic Circumpolar Current. The Antarctic Circumpolar Current encircles Antarctica and influences the area\\'s climate, connecting currents in several oceans. [113]\\n\\nRelationship of currents and climate Main article: Atlantic meridional overturning circulation\\n\\nMap of the Gulf Stream, a major ocean current that transports heat from the equator to northern latitudes and moderates the climate of Europe. Collectively, currents move enormous amounts of water and heat around the globe influencing climate. These wind driven currents are largely confined to the top hundreds of meters of the ocean. At greater depth, the thermohaline circulation (Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC), which is part of a global thermoholine circulation, drives water motion.The AMOC is driven by the cooling of surface waters in the polar latitudes in the north and south, creating dense water which sinks to the bottom of the ocean. This cold and dense water moves slowly away from the poles which is why the waters in the deepest layers of the world ocean are so cold. This deep ocean water circulation is relatively slow and water at the bottom of the ocean can be isolated from the ocean surface and atmosphere for hundreds or even a few thousand years. [113] This circulation has important impacts on global climate and the uptake and redistribution of pollutants such as carbon dioxide by moving these contaminants from the surface into the deep ocean.\\n\\nOcean currents greatly affect Earth\\'s climate by transferring heat from the tropics to the pol', metadata={'source': 'stor\\\\untitled.txt'})]"
